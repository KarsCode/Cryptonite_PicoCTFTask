### Where Are The Robots?

A robots.txt file is a text file used to communicate with web crawlers and other automated web robots (like search engine crawlers or spiders) to dictate which parts of a website should be crawled or not crawled. It's a part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol, which is a standard used by websites to manage the activities of search engine bots and other web robots.


The robots.txt file is placed at the root of a website and contains directives that specify the areas of a website that robots are allowed to access and index and those they are not allowed to access. This file includes commands that instruct bots on which pages or sections should not be crawled, which can be useful for privacy, security, or to prevent certain pages from appearing in search engine results.

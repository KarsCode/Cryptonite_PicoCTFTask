### Most Cookies

To solve this problem, I first needed a good understanding of the concept of Flask Cookies. 
From the server.py code snippet below it is clear that we need to be the Admin to view the flag.

```python
	if session.get("very_auth"):
		check = session["very_auth"]
		if check == "admin":
			resp = make_response(render_template("flag.html", value=flag_value, title=title))
			return resp
```

I then used the command line tool flask-unsign to uncover the secret key and forge the required cookie that would let us view the flag.

On reloading the page after entering the required cookie the flag is displayed.

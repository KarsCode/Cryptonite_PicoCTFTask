A PCAP (Packet Capture) file is a file format used to store network packet data captured during network traffic monitoring and analysis. It stands for Packet Capture and can contain network data such as Ethernet frames, IP packets, and other network-related information. PCAP files are widely used in the field of network analysis and security for various purposes.

To solve this problem we make use of the WireShark tool. Wireshark is a widely used open-source network protocol analyzer. It allows users to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network in real-time or examine packet details offline from a stored capture. Here are the key aspects of Wireshark:

Packet Capture: Wireshark is capable of capturing and analyzing the network traffic on a live network. It captures data from the network and displays the information in a human-readable format.

Live Packet Analysis: Users can monitor and inspect network traffic in real-time, examining packets as they traverse the network. Wireshark displays various details within the captured packets, including source and destination IP addresses, protocols used, packet timing, payload data, and more.

The Wireshark search filter tcp contains "pico" is used to filter packets that contain the specific string "pico" within the TCP payload.

tcp: This part of the filter specifies that Wireshark should focus on TCP packets, filtering only those packets that use the Transmission Control Protocol.

contains: This operator instructs Wireshark to look for a specific string within the TCP payload of the packets.

"pico": The string "pico" is the text Wireshark will search for within the TCP packet payloads. It's enclosed in double quotation marks to indicate the specific sequence of characters to be found. 
Hence, the flag is obtained.

### 13
This is an example of ROT-13 which is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. It's a type of Caesar cipher, a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
I used an online decoder on CyberChef to solve this problem.

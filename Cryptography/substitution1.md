### substitution1

Similar to the previous question, in "substitution1," a monoalphabetic substitution cipher is presented, but the key for decryption is not provided. I utilized an online tool to perform a frequency attack, as hinted by the problem statement. By analyzing the frequency distribution of the ciphertext and comparing it with typical frequency distributions of letters in the English language, the corresponding flag was discovered after decoding the cipher.

The decryption was performed using the following online tool: [Substitution Solver](https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver).

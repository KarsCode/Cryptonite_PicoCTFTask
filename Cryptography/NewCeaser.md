### New Caesar

The provided code essentially implements a basic encryption method. It encodes the plaintext using a custom Base16-like encoding and then applies a simple Caesar cipher shift on each character of the encoded text based on a single-character key. The security of this encryption method is relatively weak due to its reliance on a small 16-character alphabet and a single-character key for encryption.

We can create a script to reverse the encryption as follows:

The script aims to decrypt the encoded text using all possible keys and displays the resulting potential plaintexts for manual inspection.

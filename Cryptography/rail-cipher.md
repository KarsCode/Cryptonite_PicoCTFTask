### rail-cipher
The Rail Fence Cipher is a type of transposition cipher that rearranges the plaintext letters by writing them in a zigzag pattern across a number of "rails" or "levels." Using an online decoder can be easily solved. 

Given the number of rails and the ZigZag ciphertext, decoding is thus performed.

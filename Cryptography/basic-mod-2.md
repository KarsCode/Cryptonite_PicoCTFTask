To decrypt the given set of numbers we are also given the following procedure:
Take each number mod 41 and find the modular inverse for the result. Then map to the following character set: 1-26 are the alphabet, 27-36 are the decimal digits, and 37 is an underscore.
Here is the python script that uses a tool for modular inverse to find the flag

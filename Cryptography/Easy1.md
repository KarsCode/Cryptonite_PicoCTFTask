### Easy1
The problem is an example of a Vigenère Cipher and I utilized an online decoder on CyberChef to solve the problem. 
The Vigenère cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher and an extension of the Caesar cipher. It is more secure than the simple Caesar cipher because it uses a keyword or key phrase to encrypt the plaintext.  
The below table was provided, and using an online decoder this problem was solved.

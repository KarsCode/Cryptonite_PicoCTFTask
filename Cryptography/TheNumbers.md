If we interpret the numbers within the curly braces as corresponding to letters (using the standard A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26), it forms a message. Each number is replaced with its corresponding letter in the alphabet. Here is a python script that generates the flag. 

```python
def numbers_to_text(numbers):
    text = ""
    for num in numbers.split():
        if num.isdigit():
            text += chr(int(num) + 64) if int(num) != 26 else 'Z'
        else:
            text += num  # Retain non-numeric characters
    return text

sequence = "16 9 3 15 3 20 6 { 20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14 }"

# Converting the numbers to their corresponding letters
decoded_text = numbers_to_text(sequence)

print(decoded_text)
```
